When downloading DICOM images the download link will save a *.TCIA \"manifest\" file rather than the actual images. These manifest files must be opened with a helper application called the [NBIA Data Retriever](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/egOnAg). The Data Retriever can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The Linux version also supports a command-line interface option which can be used on Google Colab.  \n",

From the [Browse Collections](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collections) page you can use the filter box (top right of the table of datasets) to filter out datasets of interest.  Try typing \"lung cancer CT\".  This should reduce the table to 24 results.  In order to find out which datasets also have segmentations you can add \"SEG\" or \"RTSTRUCT\" to the filter.  For the sake of this example, let's try using \"lung cancer CT seg\".  This should reduce the results to 3 datasets.  Let's assume that you find the [NSCLC-Radiomics-Interobserver1](https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2019.cwvlpd26) collection to be the most interesting.  Clicking on the link to this dataset in the table will open its summary page. \n",

Click the blue \"Download\" button for the Images and Segmentations to save the associated manifest file.  You can then upload this file to Colab, and open it using the NBIA Data Retriever by running the following code.\n"
